### Project Description

This paper demostrate small fire extinguishing system using an arduino UNO. Firefighter system that sense fire automatically and immediately starts water pump and take control over the fire. Alarm activates immediately while flame sensor catches the flame and sends alert on the device it is linked to.

#### Built With
This project is based on the Arduino UNO kit, an open source programmable microcontroller board based on the datasheet (ATmega328p). Board contains 14 digital input/output pins. They are all divided as 6 PWM outputs and 6 analog inputs, it connects to your pc via USB cable or any other power source of 5v. Arduino is programmed with c/c++.This kit contains small electronic devices that are implemented in this project, excluding wifi module, flame sensor module and mini submersible water pump.
