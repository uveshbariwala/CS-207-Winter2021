### Project Description

This paper demostrate small fire extinguishing system using an arduino UNO. Firefighter system that sense fire automatically and immediately starts water pump and take control over the fire. Alarm activates immediately while flame sensor catches the flame and sends alert on the device it is linked to.

#### Built With
This project is based on the Arduino UNO kit, an open source programmable microcontroller board based on the datasheet (ATmega328p). Board contains 14 digital input/output pins. They are all divided as 6 PWM outputs and 6 analog inputs, it connects to your pc via USB cable or any other power source of 5v. Arduino is programmed with c/c++.This kit contains small electronic devices that are implemented in this project, excluding wifi module, flame sensor module and mini submersible water pump.

### Getting started
Once you have got your Arduino UNO kit and the required materials, We are ready to build this creative project. Below is the checklist that contains all the necessary components for the project.

- Arduino UNO
- Jumper wires
- Two LED's (Green, Red)
- Piezo buzzer
- Flame sensor module
- Wifi module
- Water pump
- Resistor(2.2 K-Ohm)
- Transistor
- Diode
#### Circuit

#### Installation
Download the Arduino IDE for your PC, Integrated Development Environment contains a text editor for writing code, a toolbar with buttons for various function and series of menus. The code written in the IDE is then uploaded to function the arduino. There are two buttons, verify(check your code for error while compiling) and Upoad(Uploads code to the configured board). The sketches are saved with the file extension (.ino) in the designated folder.
Get Arduino IDE for the windows/Mac [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

### Usage
